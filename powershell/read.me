In powershell run the command- Install-Module -Name Carbon
I created a simple script called lab7.ps1 in my powershell folder simply do ./lab7.ps1
The script will run some useful commands that are added with the Carbon pluggin. Just follow the prompts they give you I set it up so first you will create a user with a password 
description. Then you will be able to see all the users on the local machine, lastly you can search for a user indiviudally (i recommend the one you created earlier.)
