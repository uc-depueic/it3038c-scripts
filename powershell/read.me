First run the command Install-Module -Name Carbon
The script I created uses 3 useful commands avaliable with Carbon
When running the script you will first be prompt to enter a username password and description. (It will create a new user according to the information you put in)
Next it will show you all available users on the local host
Lastly it will prompt to again to enter a username (i reccommend using the one you created).
